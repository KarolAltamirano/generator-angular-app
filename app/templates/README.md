# Webpack
## Installing JavaScript libraries
- Install libraries with npm.

## Installing JavaScript libraries with broken module style
- If new installed library doesn't work properly with webpack read more about shimming modules
  [here](http://webpack.github.io/docs/shimming-modules.html).

## Installing JavaScript libraries not published in npm
- If you want to install library not published in npm but with `package.json` inside git repository
  you can install package from git repository. Read [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) how to
  install it.
- If you want to install library not published in npm and without `package.json` you can install it
  from git repository with [`napa`](https://github.com/shama/napa).
    - To install new library add it to `package.json` file to `napa` variable and run `npm install`.
      More details how to use `napa` can be found [here](https://github.com/shama/napa).
    - Probably you will need to set `resolve.alias` and `loaders` inside `webpack.config.js` for
      libraries not published in npm.

# CSS Modules
- This project uses CSS Modules
- Read more about CSS Modules [here](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
    - "A CSS Module is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default."

# SCSS Source maps
- Source maps are disabled for SCSS files because of an issue with style-loader
  ([read more here](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader/issues/93)). As a workaround add to each
  SCSS file a comment containing its path.
- In case SCSS source map are necessary for debugging
    - set `publicPath` inside `webpack.config.js` file to `http://localhost:3000/`
    - enable source maps inside `webpack.config.js` as described
      [here](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#source-maps)
    - important: before committing revert these changes, do not push enabled source maps to the repo

# Modernizr configuration
- To configure modernizr change its settings inside `.modernizrrc`.
- List of all available settings:
  [show](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/master/lib/config-all.json)

# CSS compatibility configuration
- To set autoprefixer for CSS set `autoprefixer` variable inside `config.json`.
- Default value: `['last 2 versions']`.
- List of available values: [show](https://github.com/ai/browserslist#queries)

# Config file 'config.json'
```  
buildDir     : Directory where built page will be placed (default 'dist')
autoprefixer : Configuration of autoprefixer
```

# Build version
To hide build version info set `renderVersionInfo` to `false` inside `src/entry/utilities/appSettings.js` file.
To bump version use npm task `npm run bump [ major | minor | patch ]`

# Test
Run unit tests with `npm test` or e2e tests with `npm run e2e`
- Before running e2e test install `mocha` globally by running `npm install -g mocha`
- Karma homepage: [show](https://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html)
- Protractor homepage: [show](https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/)

# Linting
Use linter in your text editor for JavaScript, SCSS and HTML.

## JavaScript
- For JavaScript use [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). The project contains ESLint configuration
  file `.eslintrc`
- ESLint for Atom - [show](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint)
- ESLint for Sublime Text - [show](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint)

## SCSS
- For SCSS use [SCSS-Lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint). The project contains SCSS-Lint
  configuration file `.scss-lint.yml`
- SCSS-Lint for Atom - [show](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-scss-lint)
- SCSS-Lint for Sublime Text - [show](https://github.com/attenzione/SublimeLinter-scss-lint)

## HTML
- For HTML use [HTMLHint](https://github.com/yaniswang/HTMLHint). The project contains HTMLHint
  configuration file `.htmlhintrc`
- HTMLHint for Atom - [show](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-htmlhint)
- HTMLHint for Sublime Text - [show](https://github.com/mmaday/SublimeLinter-contrib-htmlhint)

# Susy and Breakpoint
- To create page layout use Susy. Susy is Sass library for creating powerful, custom layouts.
  For more information check out Susy [homepage](http://susy.oddbird.net/).
- For creating breakpoints use Susy mixin `susy-breakpoint`. The mixin uses internally
  Sass library Breakpoint. Check out Breakpoint [homepage](http://breakpoint-sass.com/) for
  all possible queries.

# Assets mixins
- `@include retina-inline-asset($name, $ext: 'png')` mixin for generating css with background
  image encoded in base64 for non-retina and retina screens used in scssSprite.
- `@include retina-asset($name, $ext: 'png')` mixin for generating stile with background
  image for non-retina and retina screens.		

# Hot Module Replacement (experimental)
HMR is not enabled for any file by default. To enable HMR for particular file add following code
to the file:

```
if (module.hot) {
    module.hot.accept();
}
```

- More about HMR with webpack [here](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack.html)
- HMR API documentation [here](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html)
